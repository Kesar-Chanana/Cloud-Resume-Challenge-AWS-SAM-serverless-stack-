# Cloud-Resume-Challenge-AWS-SAM-serverless-stack-
This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS Edition), a hands-on project designed to deepen cloud and DevOps skills. The goal was to build a static resume website with a live visitor counter, fully hosted on AWS using serverless architecture and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS SAM.
